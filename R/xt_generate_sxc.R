#' Calculate Cross Sections from Banklines
#'
#' Calculate cross sections from banklines that are roughly equally spaced
#' apart.
#' @param n The number of cross sections to calculate.
#' @param bankline An sf object with banklines.
#' @return An "sxc" object.
#' @details This function takes the definition of "cross section" relative
#' to a point in the channel to be the line segment intersecting the point
#' whose bank-to-bank segment width is the smallest. Note that this does not
#' imply that the cross section is unique, and in this case the cross section
#' is arbitrarily taken to be the one closest to a 0-degree angle --
#' although in almost all cases this should not be an issue.
#'
#' To define the spacing of the cross sections, a centerline is
#' first calculated, and equally spaced points are sampled along the
#' centerline. Cross sections are calculated at these points. Note that
#' cross sections are not a necessary part of choosing cross section spacing,
#' but it is useful.
#' @note The function the calculates bank-to-bank width for a given angle of
#' the line crossing through a specified point is riddled with local minima.
#' Currently, a remedial approach is taken to mitigating this:
#' it first finds the minimum width on a grid of 10 angles between 0 and pi
#' (inclusive) (or 100 if the minimum is not unique at first), and then
#' optimizes the width function around the minimum found on the grid. This
#' slows down the algorithm noticeably, but not
#' It's still possible, although likely very rare, for the global minimum
#' to be missed. An improvement might involve choosing angles that do
#' not intersect with the neighbouring cross section.
#'
#' Another improvement to consider is to ensure cross sections go between
#' left bank and right bank. Since points are being sampled along the
#' centerline, this should be less of an issue, but there's still a chance
#' where a cross section will be identified for a "bay" in the channel.
